Finally, I have set up a new blogging website :MyZenCoding. As the name suggests this blog is targeted to be a window through which one can witness the progress I make as I learn new programming languages and paradigms. Coding with a sense of Zen, a meditation practice which encourages mindfullness and awareness, is what I am aiming for.
